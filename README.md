This is an ATTEMPTED port of the [dual-mc33926-motor-driver-rpi](https://github.com/pololu/dual-mc33926-motor-driver-rpi/) library from Python to Java.

It's marked ATTEMPTED because it does not yet work - must be something stupid small wrong somewhere... input welcome from anyone reading and being able to spot the difference between this port and the diff the original Python code, supposed to be identical!
